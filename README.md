## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in analysing fantasy football data to answer two basic questions:

1. Which offensive positions should you draft early?
2. How does the strength of an opposing defense affect the play of certain players?

## Results

1. It was determined that the most important position is the QB, however, early draft picks should focus on RB and WR.
2. It was determined that with at least one examined player, there was a correlation between strength of defense and points scored.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one Jupyter Notebook.
